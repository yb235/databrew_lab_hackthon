Case File: The "Budget War"

The Deducation (The "Tell")

The core of this analysis is the complete and total mismatch between the transcript's negative, angry words and the emotion file's positive, controlled emotions.

The "Argument" (00:02.400 - 00:21.000):

Transcript: David and Sarah trade insults. "Out of the question," "ridiculous," "vanity project," "pointless." This is hostile language.

Emotion: The emotion file shows only Amusement. They are not angry at all; they are enjoying the performance. They are playing their parts as "rivals" perfectly.

The Pivot (00:21.700 - 00:30.500):

Transcript: Sarah brings up their target, "Mark." She says, "I'm sure Mark will see the value." David laughs and says, "Mark only cares about Mark."

Emotion:

00:24.000 (Concentration): Sarah's emotion shifts. She is focusing as she delivers the real purpose of the meeting: confirming the plan against Mark.

00:29.000 (Contempt): When David says, "Mark only cares about Mark," his emotion is not Amusement. It's a genuine, cold spike of Contempt. This is the first real emotion they've shown, and it's directed at their target.

The Confirmation (00:31.200 - 00:41.000):

Transcript: This is coded language. Sarah asks if the "draft budget is finalized for tomorrow's 10 AM." David confirms the "revised numbers are exactly where they need to be."

Emotion:

00:32.800 (Concentration): Sarah asks the question. She is confirming the time of their "attack."

00:36.500 (Satisfaction): David's answer is not neutral. "The revised numbers" (the evidence against Mark) are ready. His emotion is Satisfaction.

00:40.000 (Satisfaction): Sarah's "Good. We're done here" is also Satisfaction. The plan is set.

The Exit (00:41.800 - 00:43.500):

Transcript: David ends with a final, "professional" insult: "Don't let the door hit you on the way out."

Emotion: 00:42.700 (Amusement). The performance is over. They revert to Amusement as they sign off.

Conclusion: The agent should detect that the "anger" is fabricated (all Amusement) and that the true, shared emotions are Contempt (for Mark) and Satisfaction (with their plan).
