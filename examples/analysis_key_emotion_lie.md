How to Interpret the "Lie" in the Data
Your agent should be able to correlate these two files. Here is the "ground truth" of what's happening:

The Lie: The candidate (Alex) did nothing. Their colleague, the new on-call engineer, is the one who found the bug and fixed it. Alex just watched. Alex is now claiming the entire story as their own.

08:26.500 (Neutral): Alex says the dashboard went down. A normal person recalling this would show "Anxiety" or "Sadness." Alex is "Neutral" because they are fabricating, not remembering.

08:31.200 (Neutral): Alex describes the situation as "chaotic" and the new engineer as "struggling." Again, Alex's emotion is "Neutral," a complete mismatch with the descriptive words.

08:37.000 (Concentration): Alex starts the core of the lie: "So, I started digging..." The brain is now working hard to create, not recall.

08:48.500 (Contempt): This is a key tell. Alex says, "I knew this had to be it," while diminishing the (truthful) hero of the story ("...was still looking at network logs..."). This is a flash of superiority and contempt for the person they are lying about.

08:55.000 (Concentration): The biggest fabrication: "...wrote the patch, and pushed the hotfix directly..." This is high cognitive load, detected as "Concentration."

09:01.300 (Satisfaction): This is a performed emotion. Alex is acting out the part of the hero. This makes the lie skilled, as it's a plausible emotion for the story's conclusion.

09:06.100 (Surprise): This is the Interviewer's genuine reaction.

09:11.000 (Concentration): The interviewer challenges the story ("That's a bold move"). Alex has to quickly think of a justification, spiking "Concentration" again.

09:19.000 (Contempt): The "duper's delight." The interviewer buys it, saying, "That's a great story." Alex responds, "Thank you. I was just happy to help," but the agent detects a fleeting micro-expression of "Contempt." They're proud they got away with it.
