The "Love Story" Told by the Data
Your agent would process this and, if it were human, would see the following:

00:09.200 - 00:09.400 (Elias): Elias walks in, sees Leo for the first time, and his voice has a micro-expression of Surprise followed by Joy before he quickly suppresses it back to Neutral. He's instantly struck by him.

00:13.200 - 00:13.400 (Leo): Leo, in turn, is caught off guard by Elias. His professional "excited to be here" line is undercut by a flash of Surprise and Anxiety (butterflies).

00:17.000 (Elias): Elias is nervous. His line "I just wanted to check in" is paired with Anxiety. He's trying to act like a cool boss, but he's flustered.

00:21.400 (Leo): Leo laughs, and the emotion detected is genuine Joy. He's comfortable and finds Elias endearing.

00:26.300 (Elias): Elias says, "that's my baby," and feels Satisfaction. He's proud of his work and is secretly happy to be sharing it with Leo.

00:34.200 (Elias): Elias says, "I'm rambling... Sorry." The emotion is Anxiety. He's worried he's making a bad impression.

00:38.100 (Leo): Leo says, "No! Not at all." He's not just being polite; the emotion is Joy. He's genuinely enjoying the interaction.

00:42.500 (Elias): Elias is Surprised and Satisfied that Leo ("most people get confused") understands him and his complex work so quickly. He's impressed.

00:45.900 (Leo): Leo says, "I like it," and the emotion is Joy. He's not just talking about the code.

00:48.800 (Elias): Elias "clears his throat." This is a classic tell. He is so flustered by the connection that he abruptly ends the meeting, the emotion detected is Anxiety.

00:52.300 (Elias): His final "Let me know if you need anything" is marked by Concentration. He's putting effort into sounding normal.

00:56.000 & 00:58.500 (Leo & Elias): The conversation ends with both speakers showing clear, unambiguous Joy as they say goodbye.
