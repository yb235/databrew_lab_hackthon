Case File: The Case of the Stolen Attestation
Suspect: Lord Alistair
Interviewer: Sherlock Holmes

The Alibi vs. The Truth

The Alibi: Lord Alistair claims he was in his study from 9 PM to midnight, working on his memoirs, and never left. He says a servant must have stolen the document.

The Truth: Lord Alistair has a secret gambling debt. He stole the attestation (a document of ownership) himself to give to his creditor. He is also an avid, if secret, billiards player.

The Deducation (Holmes's Method)

The Crime: Lord Alistair needed to sneak out of his study, go to the Billiards Room (to meet his creditor), and then slip out the east-wing door to give him the document.

The Trace Evidence:

The Scuff: To get to the east-wing door, he had to cross the marble hall. His hard-soled house slippers scuffed the marble.

The Chalk: The creditor, impatient, was playing billiards while he waited. When Lord Alistair took the document from its case (which had a dusty, chalky-blue binding), he transferred that dust to his fingers. He then met his creditor, who gave him a cube of blue billiards chalk for "luck."

The Error: Lord Alistair, in his haste, mistook the blue document dust on his fingers for blue billiards chalk, a substance he was very familiar with. He wiped his hands on his velvet slippers to clean them. He left a tell-tale smear of blue document dust on his slippers.

Data Correlation: The "Tell"

Your agent should analyze the emotional baseline and identify the one critical, anomalous spike.

Baseline (00:00 - 00:58): Lord Alistair is a skilled liar. He maintains Concentration (when stating his alibi) and Contempt (when blaming the servants). His baseline is cool and controlled.

The Trap (00:59.000): Holmes changes the subject to something seemingly absurd: "You play billiards, my Lord?"

The "Tell" (01:01.300 - 01:01.700):

Transcript: Lord Alistair says, "I... what? No. I haven't played in years."

Emotional Data: In this 0.4-second span, his emotions betray him. The data shows a rapid cascade of:

Surprise: Why is he asking about billiards? How could he know?

Fear: He knows! He knows about the chalk!

Neutral: He suppresses the fear and delivers his (false) verbal denial.

The Confirmation (01:18.400): When Holmes connects the chalk to the document, Lord Alistair's emotion is not Fear (which he's suppressing) but Anger. He is furious at being caught.

Holmes's Emotion (01:21.000): Holmes, having confirmed his theory by the emotional spike at 01:01.500, shows a brief, internal flash of Satisfaction. The case is closed.
