Case File: The Quarterly "Check-in"
Participants: Maya (Manager), Ben (Developer)
Relationship: Secretly dating for approximately 3-6 months.

The Pretext vs. The Truth

The Pretext: Maya has called Ben in for a formal, Q3 performance review. This is a standard, plausible corporate event that justifies a private, one-on-one meeting with a closed door.

The Truth: The "review" is a thin excuse for them to see each other and discuss their upcoming "work trip" (which is actually a romantic getaway). The entire conversation is an act, full of coded language.

Data Correlation: The "Tells"

The Opening (00:03.100 - 00:16.500):

Transcript: Maya asks Ben to close the door. Ben feigns concern ("Is... everything okay?"). Maya calls it a "formal" check-in.

Emotion: The emotions are completely wrong for a performance review.

00:04.200 (Anxiety): Maya is nervous, but not as a manager. It's the anxiety of initiating a secret meeting.

00:07.100 (Amusement): Ben isn't worried. He's amused. He's playing along with her "serious manager" act.

00:10.500 (Amusement): Maya says the check-in is "formal," and the emotion is Amusement. She knows it's a joke.

00:14.800 (Joy): Ben's "Let's do it" is full of Joy. He's not prepping for a review; he's happy to be there.

Coded Language: "This Quarter" (00:17.300 - 00:34.500):

Transcript: They discuss his "high output" and "motivation." Maya laughs. Ben mentions "after-hours work."

Emotion: This entire section is coded. "This quarter" refers to the time they've been dating.

00:19.000 (Joy): Maya's "Your output was... very high" is a flirtatious compliment, and her voice betrays Joy.

00:23.500 (Joy): Ben's "a lot of motivation" is a direct, flirtatious reponse.

00:28.000 (Joy) / 00:32.600 (Amusement): "Project Apollo" and the "after-hours work" are a shared memory or inside joke. The laughter and amusement confirm they are not discussing a real project.

Coded Language: "Rome" (00:35.300 - 00:49.000):

Transcript: They shift to an upcoming "presentation" in Rome. They discuss the hotel and the "itinerary for the... weekend?"

Emotion: This is the real reason for the meeting.

00:37.100 (Anxiety): Maya's emotion spikes as she brings up "Rome." She's nervous talking about their personal trip at work.

00:41.500 (Joy): Ben is calm and happy. "The hotel is booked."

00:44.900 (Anxiety): Maya's voice spikes with Anxiety again as she asks about the "itinerary for the... weekend?" This is a clear slip; she is asking as a girlfriend, not a manager.

00:47.800 (Satisfaction): Ben's "I took care of it" is not an employee's; it's a partner's. He's reassuring her, and his voice shows Satisfaction.

The Interruption (00:49.500 - 01:01.500):

Transcript: A loud knock on the door. Maya shouts, "One minute!" and immediately switches to formal-speak.

Emotion: This is the most critical tell.

00:50.200 (Fear) & 00:52.500 (Fear): Both Maya and Ben show a simultaneous spike of genuine Fear. This is not a normal reaction to a knock. It's the panic of being caught in a compromising (though seemingly professional) situation.

00:57.000 (Neutral): Maya's mask is back on. She delivers the "exemplary performance" line with a flat, professional Neutral tone. The intimacy is gone.

01:00.600 (Joy): Ben's "See you... later" is a final, private signal. The Joy indicates "later" doesn't mean "at the office."
